            on the left.  When the the count reaches zero, the cursor will disappear from the input text field, temporarily
            preventing any further input

      The Typing Game (TTT) is designed to not really have a start and a finish.  Just use it for as long as you wish.  
      Take a break and come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      TTT will start out easy and get more difficult as you get more confident. (Assuming the option to automatically
      adjust difficulty is selected)
