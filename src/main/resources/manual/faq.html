    <p>
      Some information about <a href="index.html">The Typing Tutor</a>(TTT) in an FAQ format.
    </p>
    <h3>What is TTT?</h3>
    <p>
      TTT is designed to help you learn to use a computer keyboard.  It supports (or will in the near future) support 
      a number of alternative keyboard formats.  Here are a few examples:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Standard QWERTY layout
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~dylan/dvorak/dvorak.html">Dvorak</a> (common alternative layout)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.alphagrip.com">AlphaGrip</a> (keyboard and mouse in a 'gamepad' style device)
        </li>
        <!-- Sorry...li>
          <a href="http://www.newstandardkeyboards.com/Product.html">New Standard Keyboard</a> (compact alphabetic keyboard)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="http://www.frogpad.com/">FrogPad</a> (one handed keyboard)
        </li-->
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>How do you use TTT?</h3>
    <p>
      Have a look at the <a href="instructions.html">instructions page</a> for information on how to use TTT.
    </p>
    <h3>What's a Java Runtime Environment (JRE)?</h3>
    <p>
      A JRE is software that enables programs written in the Java programming language to run on your machine.  
      For more information, have a look at <a href="http://www.java.com">http://www.java.com</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Why use TTT?</h3>
    <p>
      Keyboards with alternative formats are good in theory.  The biggest problem is the learning curve followed closely
      by having to occassionally (or regularly) switch to the common QWERTY type of keyboard that 
      most other people use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manufacturers can help the later problem by making the keyboards somewhat portable.
    </p>
    <p>
      TTT helps the former problem because it <strong>provides an effective means of learning the new keyboard layout</strong>.  
      It can't make it easier, but it does help you to focus your efforts and see results.
    </p>
    <p>
      TTT can also help the later problem by letting you 're-calibrate' your typing when you switch to another keyboard layout.
      A couple minutes will help you brush up your skills before commencing use of your keyboard.
    </p>
    <h3>How does TTT work?</h3>
    <p>
      The program is so simple it is probably easier to just give it a go.  Failing that...
    </p>
    <p>
      TTT prompts the user (you) with a series of randomly selected keystrokes.  Your response is monitored using 3 measurements:
      Accuracy, Speed and Difficulty.
    </p>
      The concept of 'difficulty' is the key to TTT.  Some keystrokes are more difficult than others, which enables
      you to build your skills incrementally.  In other words, TTT can <strong>reduce the number of keys you need to learn at once</strong>
      and gradually (automatically) increase this number as you get more confident.
    <p/>
    <h3>Why is TTT so hard?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes, TTT is quite challenging.  Part of the reason is learning a new keyboard layout is just plain difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of the reason is probably the <strong>'random' nature of the keystrokes</strong> as compared to typing in whole words.  
      If you can deal with the initial frustration, you'll find it <strong>will make you a much better typist</strong>.  Ultimately,
      you should be able to just 'think' a key and your fingers should just move.  Look for the 'Zen' in mastering TTT.
    </p>
    <h3>How do I get the most out of TTT?</h3>
    <p>
      You should really decide for yourself how to get the best score.  But to start out, try following these tips:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Regular, short sessions</strong> usually yield the best results
        </li>
        <li>
          Expect to feel a little tired after a session
        </li>
        <li>
          Try not to think too hard when using TTT.  'Use the Force'
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Can I use TTT offline?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes.  Download the <a href="./offline.zip">offline.zip</a> file, unzip the contents to a folder
      and open the <i>index.html</i> (in a browser).<br/>
      It's a compressed version of this website!
    </p>
    <h3>How did you come up with TTT?</h3>
    <p>
      I like programming.  Especially self contained problems such as this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a bad back which prompted my desire to buy an <a href="http://www.alphagrip.com">AlphaGrip</a>, 
      so I could sit in the most comfortable position with my laptop and hack away.  Anytime, anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know I would have problems learning it so..."Why don't I design my ideal typing trainer?"
